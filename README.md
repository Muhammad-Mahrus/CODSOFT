# CODSOFT - Tech Internship Tasks

Welcome to my tech internship application repository! This repository showcases my skills in C++ through three tasks assigned as part of the application process.

## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

- Implemented a console-based number guessing game in C++.
- Generates a random number, and users attempt to guess the correct number.

- Created a simple console-based calculator in C++.
- Takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the corresponding operation.

## Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

- Developed a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.
- Players take turns making moves, and the game checks for wins and draws.
